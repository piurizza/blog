Hello World, Itâ€™s nice to see you there! ðŸ‘‹
\
\
My name is Pietro, and I work as a data engineer.
I've always enjoyed learning new things, and one day I wondered... what about sharing my curiosity with someone else?
Well, I'm currently writing the first page of this journey.
\
In this blog IÂ will explore both technical and non-technical aspects ofÂ the data world, taking inspiration from everything I do or read.
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions.
You can reach me out at p.iurizza#gmail.com (replace '#' with '@') or through social media.
\
\
Have a good day,
\
Pietro
