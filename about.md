Hello World, Itâ€™s nice to see you there! ðŸ‘‹
\
\
My name is Pietro, and I work as a data engineer.
\
\
I have always enjoyed learning new things, a constant challenge to satisfy my curiosity.
\
However, challenges are more fun when faced in company.
\
With this simple idea in mind, I'm now writing the first page of this endless adventure that I would like to share with you.
\
\
In this little blog of mine IÂ will explore both technical and non-technical aspects ofÂ the data world, taking inspiration from everything I do or read.
\
\
Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any suggestions.
\
You can reach me out at p.iurizza<i class="fa fa-at"></i>gmail.com or through social media.
\
\
Have a good day,
\
Pietro
